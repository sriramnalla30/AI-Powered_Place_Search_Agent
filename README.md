🧠 AI Agent Intelligence

This system operates as a true AI agent with autonomous capabilities:

🔄 Autonomous Decision Making

Smart Cache Detection: Automatically decides whether to use cached data or fetch fresh results

Intelligent Data Processing: Filters and ranks results based on relevance and recency

Self-Optimizing: Continuously improves response speed through learned caching patterns

🎯 Agent Behaviors

Memory System: Builds and maintains a growing knowledge base in Google Sheets

Context Awareness: Understands user intent and provides contextually relevant results

Continuous Learning: Each query teaches the agent about popular search patterns

Automated Data Enrichment: Proactively updates and enriches cached data over time

📈 Agent Learning Process

Initial Query → Agent fetches fresh data, learns user patterns

Data Storage → Intelligent caching with metadata and context

Pattern Recognition → Agent identifies popular search combinations

Optimization → Subsequent queries served faster with enhanced data

Continuous Improvement → Background updates keep knowledge current

🚀 Performance Intelligence

First Search: ~3-5 seconds (Fresh OpenStreetMap data + Cache building)

Repeat Searches: ~1-2 seconds (Intelligent cache retrieval)

Background Updates: Agent automatically refreshes data to maintain accuracy

✨ Key Features

🔍 Intelligent Place Discovery: Find restaurants, cafes, hostels, and more by city and area

🧠 AI-Powered Caching: Smart cache management reduces repeat query time by 70%

🗺️ Live OpenStreetMap Integration: Real-time data from the world's largest collaborative map

📊 Autonomous Data Management: Google Sheets acting as an intelligent data layer

🎯 Context-Aware Responses: Results tailored to user's specific search criteria

📱 Interactive UI: Clean, responsive interface with maps integration
